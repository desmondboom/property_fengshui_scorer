# House Layout Scoring System (Listing Score Demo)

An intelligent house layout scoring system based on traditional Chinese Feng Shui (Eight Mansions theory), which uses OCR technology to identify room labels in floor plan images and combines Nine Palace grid analysis to evaluate the auspiciousness of house layouts.

## Features

- 🏠 **Smart OCR Recognition**: Automatically identifies room labels in floor plan images (bedrooms, kitchens, bathrooms, etc.)
- 🧭 **Directional Analysis**: Analyzes room positions based on Nine Palace grid theory
- 📐 **Feng Shui Scoring**: Comprehensive scoring of house layouts based on Eight Mansions theory
- 🎯 **Detailed Recommendations**: Provides targeted layout optimization suggestions
- 📊 **Visual Output**: Generates structured JSON scoring reports

## System Architecture

The system consists of two main modules:

1. **`fp2layout.py`** - Floor Plan Analysis Module

   - Uses OpenCV for image preprocessing
   - Identifies room labels through Tesseract OCR
   - Maps room positions to Nine Palace grid system
   - Automatically infers house orientation

2. **`zhongxuan_scorer.py`** - Feng Shui Scoring Module
   - Performs auspicious/inauspicious judgments based on Eight Mansions theory
   - Scores individual room positions
   - Generates comprehensive scores and recommendations

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Tesseract OCR

### Installation Steps

1. Create conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   conda activate listing-score-env
   ```

2. Install Tesseract OCR:

   **macOS:**

## Usage

### 🌐 Web Application (Recommended)

Launch the web interface for interactive analysis:

```bash
# Activate environment
conda activate listing-score-env

# Start web application
python run_app.py
# Or use streamlit directly
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser to use the graphical interface.

**Web Application Features:**

- 📁 Drag & drop floor plan upload
- ⚙️ Visual parameter settings
- 🔍 One-click analysis and scoring
- 📊 Real-time results display

### 💻 Command Line Usage

#### 1. Floor Plan Analysis

```bash
python fp2layout.py --image data/test.png --north-deg 0.0 --house-facing S --out layout.json
```

**Parameters:**

- `--image`: Input floor plan image file path
- `--north-deg`: True north angle relative to image top (clockwise degrees)
- `--house-facing`: House orientation (N/NE/E/SE/S/SW/W/NW), optional, system will auto-infer
- `--out`: Output JSON file path

#### 2. Feng Shui Scoring

```bash
# Northern Hemisphere (default)
python zhongxuan_scorer.py layout.json

# Southern Hemisphere
python zhongxuan_scorer.py layout.json --hemisphere southern
```

**Output Example:**

```json
{
  "total": 75,
  "grade": "B",
  "house_gua": "坎宅(东四宅)",
  "breakdown": {
    "main_door": { "score": 20, "why": "大门在S(吉位)" },
    "master_bed": { "score": 0, "why": "未检测到主卧" },
    "kitchen": { "score": -10, "why": "厨房占中宫不宜" },
    "bath_laundry": { "score": 0, "why": "未检测到湿区" },
    "other_bed": { "score": 0, "why": "卧室吉0间、凶2间" },
    "garage_store": { "score": 0, "why": "0处，凶位给+1/处" },
    "center_c": { "score": -5, "why": "中宫包含：kitchen" },
    "throughline": { "score": 0, "why": "未检测/不成立" }
  },
  "advice": [
    "厨房落吉位易泄吉：宜以金属与中性色弱化火气，炉口朝宅吉方。",
    "整体格局稳健：保持整洁、通风、动静分区即可。"
  ]
}
```

## Scoring Criteria

### Eight Mansions Theory Foundation

The system is based on traditional Eight Mansions theory, categorizing houses into East Four Houses and West Four Houses:

- **East Four Houses**: Kan House (South), Li House (North), Zhen House (West), Xun House (Northwest)
- **West Four Houses**: Qian House (Southeast), Dui House (East), Gen House (Southwest), Kun House (Northeast)

### 🌍 Northern/Southern Hemisphere Feng Shui Theory

Considering the geographical differences between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the system supports two Feng Shui theories:

**Northern Hemisphere (Traditional Theory):**

- East Four Houses auspicious positions: North, East, Southeast, South
- West Four Houses auspicious positions: Northwest, Northeast, West, Southwest

**Southern Hemisphere (Adjusted Theory):**

- East Four Houses auspicious positions: South, West, Southwest, North
- West Four Houses auspicious positions: Southeast, South, East, Northeast

In Southern Hemisphere countries like Australia, the sun's path and magnetic field direction are opposite to the Northern Hemisphere, so the Feng Shui theory needs to be adjusted accordingly to ensure scoring accuracy.

## Important Notes

1. **Image Quality**: Ensure floor plans are clear with readable room label text
2. **Orientation Setting**: Accurately set true north angle for correct directional analysis
3. **Label Recognition**: System relies on OCR recognition; complex fonts or blurry text may affect accuracy
4. **Cultural Context**: Scoring criteria based on traditional Chinese Feng Shui theory, suitable for related cultural backgrounds
